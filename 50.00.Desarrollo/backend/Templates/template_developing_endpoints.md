# Backend Development Template

- **Endpoint Name**  /api/your-endpoint.

## 1. Requirement Specification
- **Description:**: Briefly describe what the endpoint does and why it is necessary.

- **Purpose:**
    - What problem does it solve?
    - How does it fit into the overall system?
    
- **Key Features:**
    - List the main functionalities of the endpoint.

## 2. API Design
- HTTP Method(s): GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- URL Path: /api/your-endpoint

- **Headers:**
    - Authentication tokens    
    - Content-Type (e.g., application/json)

- **Query Parameters:**
    -?param1=value1&param2=value2

- **Path Parameters:**
    -/api/your-endpoint/{id}

- **Request Body Schema:**
```
    {
        "field1": "value1",
        "field2": "value2"
    }
```

- **Response Body Schema:**
```
    {
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "field1": "value1",
        "field2": "value2"
    }
    }
```

- **Response Codes:**
```
    200 OK - Successful request
    201 Created - Resource created
    400 Bad Request - Validation errors
    401 Unauthorized - Authentication failed
    404 Not Found - Resource not found
    500 Internal Server Error - Server error
```

## 3. Logic Design
- **Input Validation:**
List validations for incoming data (e.g., required fields, data types).

- **Business Rules:**
Describe the business logic that the endpoint will handle.

- **Error Handling:**
How will errors be captured and returned to the client?

- **Security Measures:**
Authentication and authorization requirements.
Rate limiting, if applicable.

## 4. Data Design
- **Database Models:**
Outline the SQLAlchemy models involved.
Include relationships and constraints.

- **Database Schema:**
```
class YourModel(Base):
    __tablename__ = "your_table"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    field1 = Column(String, index=True)
    field2 = Column(Float)
    # Additional fields and relationships
```
- **External Services:**
APIs or services the endpoint interacts with.

- **Data Flow Diagram:**
(Optional) Include a diagram showing how data flows through the system.

## 5. Implementation
- **Dependencies:**
List any third-party packages or modules required.

- **Code Structure:**
Controllers, services, repositories, and models.

- **Sample Code:**
```
    from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
    from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
    from app.database import get_db
    from app.models import YourModel
    from app.schemas import YourSchema

    router = APIRouter()

    @router.post("/api/your-endpoint", response_model=YourSchema)
    async def create_item(item: YourSchema, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
        # Implementation details
        return created_item
```
- **Asynchronous Programming:**
Note any async/await usage for I/O-bound operations.

## 6. Testing
- **Testing Frameworks:**
Pytest, unittest, etc.

- **Test Cases:**
List the scenarios that will be tested.

- **Sample Test Code:**
def test_create_item(client):
    response = client.post("/api/your-endpoint", json={
        "field1": "value1",
        "field2": 123.45
    })
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["data"]["field1"] == "value1"

- **Coverage:**
Aim for a certain percentage of code coverage.

## 7. Documentation
- **Auto-generated Docs:**
Ensure Swagger UI is properly displaying the endpoint details.

- **Manual Documentation:**
Provide additional details not covered by auto-generated docs.

- **Usage Examples:**
Show how to interact with the endpoint using curl or a tool like Postman.
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/your-endpoint" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"field1": "value1", "field2": 123.45}'
```
