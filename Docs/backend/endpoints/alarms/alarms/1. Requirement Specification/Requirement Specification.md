# **Alarms Requirement Specification**

## **1. Requirement Specification**

### **Description**
The `/alarms/alarms` endpoint retrieves alarm data from the backend database. It allows the frontend to display and manage alarms.

### **Purpose**
- **Problem it solves**:
  - Provides centralized access to alarm data generated by trading strategies, ensuring data consistency and real-time updates.

- **How it fits into the overall system**:
  - Acts as a bridge between the alarm database and the user interface.

### **Key Features**
1. **Fetch Alarms**:
   - Retrieve alarms with pagination (`limit`, `offset`) to efficiently manage large datasets.
   - Sort alarms by `id` in descending order to display the most recent data first, using the `latest` parameter.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Return meaningful error messages for issues like validation errors, unauthorized access, or server errors.
