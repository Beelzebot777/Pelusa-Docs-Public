# **Testing**

## **Unit Tests**
List the specific test cases to ensure the component's functionality works as expected. Provide clear examples of what each test case should validate.

### Example:
1. **Filter Functionality**:  
   - Verify that the correct filter options are applied when the "Apply Filter" button is clicked.
   - Ensure selecting multiple checkboxes updates the filter state correctly.

2. **Dropdown Interaction**:  
   - Validate that dropdown opens and closes as expected.  
   - Ensure the correct value is selected and reflected in the state.

3. **API Integration**:  
   - Confirm that clicking the "Apply Filter" button triggers the correct API call with appropriate query parameters.

4. **Error Handling**:  
   - Test that an error message is displayed when the API fails to fetch data.

## **Test Coverage**
Describe which parts of the component are covered by tests to ensure clarity on what has been validated and highlight any gaps.

### Example:
1. **Filter Logic**:  
   - Validate the proper conversion of selected filters into query parameters.  
   - Ensure default filters are correctly applied on component load.

2. **Dropdown Interaction**:  
   - Test user interaction with dropdown components, including keyboard navigation.  
   - Validate the state updates after a selection.

3. **API Calls**:  
   - Ensure API calls are made only when necessary (e.g., after clicking the "Apply Filter" button).  
   - Verify correct error handling for failed API requests.

4. **State Synchronization**:  
   - Confirm that local state updates are properly synchronized with global Redux state.

## **Testing Tools**
List the tools and libraries required to implement the tests effectively.

### Example:
1. **Unit Testing**:  
   - **Jest**: For writing and running unit tests.  
   - **React Testing Library**: For testing React components' UI and interactions.

2. **Mocking and Assertions**:  
   - **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: For simulating API responses.  
   - **Jest Mock Functions**: For mocking Redux actions or API calls.

3. **Accessibility Testing**:  
   - **axe-core (optional)**: For automated accessibility checks during tests.

4. **Code Coverage**:  
   - **Jest Coverage Report**: To generate reports showing test coverage metrics.
