## **Input Validation**
- Define all required validations for incoming data.
  - Example:
    - `field1` must be a string.
    - `field2` must be a positive integer.

## **Business Rules**
- Describe the rules that govern the endpoint's logic.
  - Example:
    - An alarm cannot overlap with another alarm in the same time slot.

## **Error Handling**
- Explain how errors will be managed and returned.
  - Example:
    - Return a `400 Bad Request` if validation fails.
    - Log the error and return a `500 Internal Server Error` for server-side issues.

## **Security Measures**
- Define the authentication and authorization requirements.
  - Example:
    - Endpoint requires a valid JWT token.
- Mention any rate-limiting policies.
  - Example:
    - Maximum 100 requests per minute.
