# **Wireframe Design**

## **Purpose**
The purpose of the `NavBar` wireframe is to visualize its structure, layout, and functionality to ensure clear navigation within the application. It serves as a central point for switching between components while providing visual cues to indicate the state of each option (selected, inactive, or disabled).

## **Structure**
- **Main Sections**:
  1. **Vertical Sidebar**:
     - Positioned on the right side of the central panel.
     - Contains clickable icons for each main component.
  2. **Icons**:
     - Represent each component visually.
     - Include hover, selected, and disabled states.
- **Key Elements**:
  - Icon for each component (`Alarms`, `Account`, etc.).
  - State-based styling for selected, non-selected, and unimplemented components.
  - Responsiveness to adapt to various screen sizes.

## **Content**
1. **Essential Elements**:
   - **Icons**:
     - Each component is represented by a unique icon.
     - Tooltips on hover to describe the component.
   - **States**:
     - **Selected State**: High-intensity color to indicate the active component.
     - **Hover State**: Slightly increased intensity.
     - **Non-Selected State**: Reduced color intensity to indicate inactivity.
     - **Disabled State**: Gray color for unimplemented components, making them non-clickable.

## **Behavior Flow**
1. **Component Selection**:
   - Clicking on an icon activates the corresponding component.
   - The selected icon is highlighted with a high-intensity color.
2. **Hover Behavior**:
   - When hovering over an icon, its intensity slightly increases to provide feedback.
3. **Disabled Components**:
   - Icons of unimplemented components are displayed in gray.
   - These are not clickable, and their tooltips indicate "Coming Soon."
4. **Responsive Adjustments**:
   - On smaller screens, the sidebar may collapse into a horizontal bar or be accessible via a toggle menu.
