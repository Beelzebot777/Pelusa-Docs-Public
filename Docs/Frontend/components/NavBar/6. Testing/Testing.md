# **Testing Documentation for NavBar Component**

---

## **Unit Tests**
A detailed list of test cases to validate the functionality of the `NavBar` component and ensure it behaves as expected in different scenarios.

### **Test Cases**
1. **Tab Rendering**:
   - Validate that all tabs are rendered correctly based on the `tabs` prop.
   - Ensure that the icons and alt text for each tab are displayed as expected.

2. **Tab Interaction**:
   - Verify that clicking on an enabled tab triggers the `handleTabChange` function with the correct index.
   - Confirm that clicking on a disabled tab does not trigger any action.

3. **Tab Selection**:
   - Ensure that the selected tab is styled with the correct class and visually distinguishes itself.
   - Validate that a disabled tab displays the correct disabled styles.

4. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Confirm that the user can navigate between tabs using the keyboard (`Tab` and `Enter` keys).
   - Ensure that the `handleTabChange` function is triggered for enabled tabs upon pressing `Enter`.

5. **Accessibility**:
   - Validate that the `aria-selected`, `aria-disabled`, and other accessibility attributes are correctly applied to tabs.
   - Confirm that the component is navigable using assistive technologies.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensure that the component gracefully handles missing or incorrect `tabs` data by displaying fallback content or logging errors.

## **Test Coverage**
An outline of the areas covered by tests to ensure clarity about what functionality has been validated and any gaps that remain.

### **Covered Areas**
1. **Render Logic**:
   - Validate the rendering of tabs, icons, and associated labels.
   - Ensure the component's layout adapts correctly to different prop values.

2. **User Interaction**:
   - Confirm that clicks and keyboard interactions trigger the expected behaviors.
   - Validate the disabled state for tabs, ensuring no unintended actions occur.

3. **Styling**:
   - Verify the dynamic application of classes based on the `selected` and `disabled` states.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure the component adheres to accessibility standards with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard support.

### **Potential Gaps**
1. **Responsive Design**:
   - Additional tests are required to validate the component's behavior across different screen sizes and resolutions.

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Further tests are needed to validate the interaction between `NavBar` and other components or global state.
