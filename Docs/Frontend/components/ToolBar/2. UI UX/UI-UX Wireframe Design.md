# **Wireframe Design**

## **Purpose**
The purpose of the `ToolBar` wireframe is to provide a clear and organized interface that allows users to interact with the chart component (`Charts`). This toolbar centralizes key functionalities such as selecting a ticker, adjusting time intervals, adding indicators, jumping to specific timestamps, and displaying market-related clocks. Its goal is to optimize user interaction while maintaining a compact and functional layout.

## **Structure**
The `ToolBar` component is divided into the following main sections:
1. **Tickers Button**:
   - Dropdown to select financial tickers (e.g., `BTCUSD`, `ETHUSD`).
2. **Intervals Panel**:
   - Buttons to switch between time intervals (`1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1d`, `1w`, `1M`).
3. **JumpTime Button**:
   - Dropdown with an input field for selecting a specific date and time.
   - Includes action buttons: `OK Button` and `Clean Button`.
4. **Indicators**:
   - Dropdown to add/remove indicators like `Stochastic` and `EMAs`.
5. **Clock**:
   - Dropdown displaying the current time and key trading hours for major markets:
     - USA: `HH:mm:ss`
