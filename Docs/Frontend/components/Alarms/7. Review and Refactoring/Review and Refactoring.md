# **Change History**

## **Performance Optimization**

### What Changed:
- Implemented `useCallback` and optimized `useState` management in `AlarmBarChart` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### Why:
- Improve rendering performance and ensure smoother UI interactions.

### Impact:
- Reduced rendering overhead, enhancing overall responsiveness.

---

## **State Management**

### What Changed:
1. Encapsulated chart data logic in custom hooks:
   - `useGenerateBarChartData` for `AlarmBarChart`.
   - `useGenerateRadarChartData` for `AlarmsRadarChart`.
2. Modularized state management for visibility and data handling in `AlarmBarChart`.

### Why:
- Simplified the logic, improved separation of concerns, and increased reusability.

### Impact:
- Improved maintainability and testability by isolating responsibilities.

---

## **Code Modularization**

### What Changed:
1. Moved responsibilities like toggling buttons and updating months to dedicated hooks:
   - `useUpdateVisibleMonths`.
2. Renamed and modularized files:
   - `initChart` renamed to `configChart`.
3. Created `FiltersMenu` helpers to manage dropdown-related functions.
4. Organized components into folders and introduced `usePagination` hook for `AlarmTable`.

### Why:
- Enhance code clarity and reusability across components.

### Impact:
- Easier navigation and management of the codebase, reducing duplication.

---

## **Error Handling**

### What Changed:
- Added `useClickOutside` hook to handle UI interaction issues in `FiltersMenu`.

### Why:
- Prevent unexpected behavior and improve user experience.

### Impact:
- Enhanced UI reliability when interacting with dropdowns.

---

# **Future Improvements**

## **Enhanced Animations**

### Why:
- Add smooth transitions to `AlarmBarChart` and `AlarmsRadarChart`.

### Benefit:
- Enhance the visual polish and user experience.

---

## **Dynamic Component Loading**

### Why:
- Reduce initial load time by lazy-loading components like `FiltersMenu`.

### Benefit:
- Optimized performance for large-scale datasets and components.

---

## **Accessibility Enhancements**

### Why:
- Improve compliance with WCAG standards.

### Benefit:
- Broaden usability to all users, including those with disabilities.

---

## **Centralized Chart Configuration**

### Why:
- Consolidate configurations for different chart components.

### Benefit:
- Streamline updates and reduce redundancy.

---

# **Professional Refactoring Ideas**

## **Custom Hooks for State and Logic**

### Idea:
- Extend the use of custom hooks like `useUpdateVisibleMonths` for other complex state management tasks.

### Benefit:
- Improve logic encapsulation and reusability.

---

## **Advanced Error Logging**

### Idea:
- Integrate a centralized error tracking tool like Sentry for debugging production issues.

### Benefit:
- Simplify issue tracking and improve diagnostics.

---

## **Testing Coverage**

### Idea:
- Expand tests for new hooks (`useGenerateBarChartData`, `usePagination`, etc.).

### Benefit:
- Validate component logic and prevent regressions.
