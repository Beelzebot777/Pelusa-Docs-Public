Understood, the Strategies component will be built using React. Let's update the Logic Design document accordingly:

# Logic Design

## **1. Responsibilities**

### **Description**
The Strategies component is responsible for managing the activation, deactivation, and configuration of trading strategies within the application. Its internal logic handles user interactions, data processing, and error handling to ensure a seamless experience for users. The component will utilize React's state management capabilities to manage the state and facilitate communication between the Strategies component and other components in the application.

### **Key Responsibilities**

- **Behavioral Logic**:
  - Activate, pause, and stop strategies based on user interactions.
  - Update the UI to reflect the current state of strategies (active, paused, stopped).
  - Communicate with the Charts and Tables components to visualize strategy operations.

- **Data Processing**:
  - Fetch the list of available strategies and their performance data from the backend API.
  - Parse and normalize the data received from the API to ensure consistency and compatibility with the component's internal state.
  - Calculate derived values, such as the active/paused state of a strategy, based on the input data.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Implement robust error handling for API requests to ensure a graceful fallback experience for the user.
  - Display meaningful error messages to the user when there are issues fetching data or performing strategy operations.
  - Provide a way for the user to retry failed actions, such as re-fetching the strategy data.

## **2. State and Props**

### **State Management**

- **Local State**:
  - `strategies`: An array of strategy objects, containing the details of each available strategy.
  - `selectedStrategy`: The currently selected strategy, used to display its detailed settings.
  - `isLoading`: A flag indicating whether the component is currently fetching data from the API.
  - `hasError`: A flag indicating whether an error has occurred during data fetching or strategy operations.

- **Derived State**:
  - `isStrategyActive`: Derived from the `isActive` property of the selected strategy.
  - `isStrategyPaused`: Derived from the `isPaused` property of the selected strategy.

### **Props Specification**

- **Expected Props**:
  ```typescript
  interface StrategiesProps {
    onStrategyActivated: (strategy: { name: string, timestamp: string }) => void;
    onStrategyDeactivated: (strategy: { name: string, timestamp: string }) => void;
    onStrategyOperation: (operation: { strategyName: string, type: "long" | "short", timestamp: string }) => void;
  }
  ```
  - `onStrategyActivated`: Callback function triggered when a strategy is activated.
  - `onStrategyDeactivated`: Callback function triggered when a strategy is deactivated.
  - `onStrategyOperation`: Callback function triggered when a strategy performs an operation (long or short).

- **Validation and Defaults**:
  - All props are required and do not have any default values.

## **3. Events and Handlers**

### **Event Handling**

1. **User Events**:
   - **Strategy Activation**: When the user clicks the "Activate" button for a strategy, the component will update the local state to reflect the activated strategy and call the `onStrategyActivated` callback with the strategy name and the current timestamp.
   - **Strategy Deactivation**: When the user clicks the "Pause" or "Stop" button for a strategy, the component will update the local state to reflect the deactivated strategy and call the `onStrategyDeactivated` callback with the strategy name and the current timestamp.
   - **Strategy Configuration**: When the user updates the settings for a strategy, the component will update the corresponding state in the local state and trigger a re-render.

2. **System Events**:
   - **Data Fetching**: When the component mounts, it will fetch the list of available strategies and their performance data from the backend API and update the local state accordingly.
   - **Error Handling**: If an error occurs during the API request, the component will update the `hasError` state and display an appropriate error message to the user.

### **Handler Design**

```javascript
const handleStrategyActivation = (strategy) => {
  onStrategyActivated({ name: strategy.name, timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
  setSelectedStrategy(strategy);
  setIsStrategyActive(true);
  setIsStrategyPaused(false);
};

const handleStrategyDeactivation = (strategy) => {
  onStrategyDeactivated({ name: strategy.name, timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
  setIsStrategyActive(false);
  setIsStrategyPaused(false);
};

const handleStrategyConfigurationUpdate = (updatedStrategy) => {
  setStrategies((prevStrategies) =>
    prevStrategies.map((s) => (s.name === updatedStrategy.name ? updatedStrategy : s))
  );
  setSelectedStrategy(updatedStrategy);
};

const fetchStrategiesData = async () => {
  try {
    setIsLoading(true);
    const response = await fetch('/strategies');
    const data = await response.json();
    setStrategies(data.strategies);
    setStrategyPerformance(data.strategyPerformance);
  } catch (error) {
    setHasError(true);
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
};
```

## **4. Conditional Logic (Optional)**

### **Description**
The Strategies component will use conditional logic to manage the UI state and provide appropriate feedback to the user based on the current data and user interactions.

- **Rendering Loading and Error States**:
  - If `isLoading` is true, display a loading spinner or indicator to inform the user that data is being fetched.
  - If `hasError` is true, display a clear error message to the user, along with a button or action to retry the failed operation.

- **Disabling Buttons**:
  - Disable the "Activate" button for a strategy if it is already active.
  - Disable the "Pause" and "Stop" buttons for a strategy if it is not active.

- **Showing/Hiding Strategy Configuration**:
  - If a strategy is selected, display the detailed configuration options in the Strategy Settings panel.
  - If no strategy is selected, hide the Strategy Settings panel or display a message prompting the user to select a strategy.

## **5. Optimization Strategies (Optional)**

### **Performance Optimizations**

- **Memoization**:
  - Use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the strategy list items, as long as their props haven't changed.
  - Utilize `useMemo` to memoize expensive computations, such as deriving the `isStrategyActive` and `isStrategyPaused` values.

- **Debouncing**:
  - Debounce the user input when they are updating the strategy configuration to prevent excessive API calls and provide a more responsive user experience.

### **Code Reusability**

- **Custom Hooks**:
  - Extract the logic for fetching and managing the strategies and their performance data into a custom hook, such as `useStrategiesData`.
  - Create a custom hook `useStrategyConfiguration` to handle the state and logic related to the strategy configuration settings.

By utilizing React's state management capabilities, the Strategies component can ensure a consistent and efficient data flow between the different parts of the application. This also allows for better testability and maintainability of the component's internal logic.
